## Motive
As the project needs a scheduling mechanism, and we are using `Celerey` which needs a `rabbitmq` server to run.
Using the standard method is time-consuming and it is hard to manage all servers separately.
Therefore, we are using Docker.

## Docker

>[!info] Description 
>Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. It allows developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single container that can be easily moved between different environments and run consistently across different systems. This improves consistency, isolation, scalability, portability and cost-effectiveness.

## Commands

To run the compose command with all containers
```bash
docker-compose up
```

>[!note] 
>make sure you are on the docker-compose.yml file level.
